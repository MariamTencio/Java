# Development Environment
The language used to develop this program was Java. I used Swing, a java library that is used to create graphical interfaces and AWT that is also used to maage graphicald user interfaces  that have buttons, here it was used for the color managment, and awt.event that was used to handle the mouse.

# Future Work

- The brush only draws dots instead of lines
- The rectangles and ovals can't be edited to be bigger and smaller
- It does not have an option to delete dots, rectangles and ovals, it just has the option to clear the canvas.
